#Ajario - Agar.io client in Java

Something cooked up one night.

[./ajario.jar](Fat jar download - Click to open)

##Keybinds
\ -> Show fps/updates/sec
~ -> Server chooser / options
9 -> Fullscreen (broken since switch to canvas window)
ESC -> Quit
W -> Eject mass
Space -> Split
You can press any key to join a game.

##Notes
In options there is an option to show what the colors of blobs mean. These are approximations.

FPS decreased since switch to views, streams, and increased text. This is mostly irrelevant since interpolation isn't implemented
and the updates / second sent to the client is 25u/s on a vanilla server.
